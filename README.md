## Title
The Linear Regression Process: From Generation to Interpretation

## Abstract
Participants will discover the generation of a linear regression line of best fit using a small data set. Along the way we'll answer questions like: Where do the coefficients come from? How are they interpreted? What is r^2 and what does it mean? What is r and what does it tell us? (And, more importantly, what does it NOT tell us?) Finally, real data from the ISBE school report card will be used to practice reading computer generated regression information.
